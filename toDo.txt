That’s a really practical and valuable tool—here’s how I’d recommend leveling it up from a data/logistics analyst perspective:

1. Core Functionality Upgrades
	•	Smart Cutoff Calculator: Given a load size and a specific tank’s chart, calculate and return the minimum stick height required to safely receive the load.
	•	Full Stick-to-Gallons Table: Include the entire chart so users can verify their own cutoff points or see how much extra fuel would fit.
	•	Overfill Margin: Let the user set a safety margin (e.g., 200 gallons) so you don’t deliver up to the exact max.

⸻

2. Store/Tank Intelligence
	•	Multi-Tank Logic: Handle locations with multiple tanks for the same fuel type (e.g., two 12k tanks for regular gas) and sum their capacities or distribute load accordingly.
	•	Tank Condition Flags: Add metadata—e.g., “tank offline,” “partial fill only,” “venting issue,” etc.—to alert drivers of special considerations.

⸻

3. Historical Tracking & Estimation
	•	Last Known Stick Reading: Store the last known stick reading and estimated gallons remaining for each tank.
	•	Burn Rate Modeling: If possible, track previous deliveries and stick readings to estimate fuel usage rates at each location.

⸻

4. User Interface Enhancements
	•	Simple Input Form: Allow the user to select a store, fuel type, and load size, and immediately get the cutoff stick and table.
	•	Exportable Report: Output a short, printable report (PDF or PNG) for each store/delivery.

⸻

5. Integration Ideas
	•	GPS Map View (using Folium or other tools): Show all your stores on a map with color-coded markers (e.g., green = good, red = won’t fit).
	•	CSV or SQL Import/Export: Let yourself (or others) batch update tank charts or store data easily.

⸻

6. Long-Term Advanced Features
	•	Forecasting: Estimate when a tank will be ready to receive a delivery based on past usage.
	•	Optimization Engine: Suggest which order to deliver in based on travel time, tank readiness, and load balancing.
